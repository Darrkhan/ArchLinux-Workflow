# Cybersecurity-focused Student Workflow

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my workflow as an engineering student. This repository includes details on the tools I will be using and my updated Arch Linux configuration.
> [!NOTE]
> I regularly experiment with various Linux distributions. Please let me know if you have any recommendations or questions,
> I'll more than happy to answer them. Please note, however, that I may not be using Arch at the time.
## Arch Linux Installation

The system is set up on a Btrfs file system nested within an encrypted LVM volume. For a step-by-step installation guide, please refer to my [installation guide](https://gist.github.com/Darrkhan/f23f0f8e185876e01a1708a90eb2f782).

## Configuration and Ricing

I have opted for Hyprland with Waybar and nwg-drawer, following all my requirements. Both Wlogout and Swaylock function seamlessly and can be customized easily.

## Software

- **Libvirt with KVM/QEMU:** Used for managing all my virtual machines, especially Kali.
- **IntelliJ Community:** Serving as my Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
- **Proton VPN (AUR GTK App):** Ensuring secure and private network connections.
- **Neovim:** My preferred text editor for smaller projects.
- **VSCode (Code-OSS):** Employed for larger-scale projects.
- **Obsidian:** Utilized for note-taking and organization.
- **Chromium:** My web browser of choice.
- **Timeshift and grub-btrfs:** Employed for system snapshots and backups.
- **Thunar File Manager:** Handling file management tasks.
- **Kitty Terminal:** Serving as my terminal emulator.

Feel free to explore and adapt elements of my workflow to enhance your's. If you're interested, my dotfiles and potentially an installation script are available within this repository.
