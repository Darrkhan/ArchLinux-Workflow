# Cybersecurity-focused Engineering Workflow

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my workflow as an engineering student specializing in cybersecurity for the year 2024. This repository includes details on the tools I will be using and my updated Arch Linux configuration.

## Arch Linux Installation

The system is set up on a Btrfs file system nested within an encrypted LVM volume. For a step-by-step installation guide, please refer to my [installation guide](https://gist.github.com/Darrkhan/f23f0f8e185876e01a1708a90eb2f782).

## Configuration and Ricing

While I may not consider myself an expert at ricing, I've put effort into creating a clean and efficient configuration. I have opted for Hyprland with Waybar and nwg-drawer, a combination that I find particularly effective on Wayland, addressing all my requirements. Both Wlogout and Swaylock function seamlessly and can be customized easily.
